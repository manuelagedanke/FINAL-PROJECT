					<h3>Bad consequences are clearly affecting the school in lots of different ways:<br> <br>

<li>There is a bad environment because students are stressed and unhappy</li>
<li>There is a decrease in academic performance due to demotivation and little desire of attending school</li>
<li>Students’ self-esteem is low and they have little confidence because they have very little support from their</li> classmates.
<li>Problems between students and teachers generate tension and anger.</h3>
