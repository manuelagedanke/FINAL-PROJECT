<h1>Decreasing stress and anxiety in teenagers</h1>

<h2>Positive relationships can be a powerful buffer against stress and anxiety. When young people feel connected to others and know that they have people they can rely on, they're less likely to feel overwhelmed by stressors. Relationships can provide a source of support and comfort, helping young people feel more capable of handling life's ups and downs.  </h2>

<h1>Increase self-esteem</h1>

<h2>Positive relationships help young people develop a sense of self-worth and confidence, which can have a positive impact on their mental health. When a young person feels seen, heard, and valued by those around them, they are more likely to have a positive self-image. This can lead to improved self-esteem and a healthier sense of identity. </h2>

<h1>Greater sense of belonging</h1> 

<h2>Feeling like you belong is an essential component of good mental health. When young people feel like they belong to a community and are accepted, they're more likely to feel valued, seen, and supported.</h2>

<h1>Improved academic outcomes</h1> 

<h2>Positive relationships can have a significant impact on academic outcomes, too. When students feel connected to their teachers, they're more likely to be engaged in class, participate, and ultimately, achieve their academic goals.</h2>

<h1>Improved behaviour and attitude to learning</h1>

<h2>Positive relationships can also have a significant impact on student behaviour and attitude to learning. When students feel connected, respected, and valued by their teachers, they're more likely to behave positively in the classroom. They may also feel more motivated to learn and engage with class material.</h2>
