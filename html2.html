						Good relationships between teenagers at school are essential for their social, emotional, academic, and mental well-being. These relationships shape how they interact with the world around them, help them develop important life skills, and provide the foundation for positive future interactions. <br> <br>


Fostering an environment where teens can build strong, supportive relationships is a key factor in promoting their overall development and happiness during these formative years.<br> <br>


It is very important for schools to incite good relationships between students for them to feel comfortable, happy and as a result succeed academically and personally
